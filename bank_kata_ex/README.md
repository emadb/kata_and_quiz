### My (*unfinished*) solution

Started from defining an acceptance test:

> Given a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012  
And a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012  
And a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012  
When she prints her bank statement  
Then she would see  
date       || credit   || debit    || balance  
14/01/2012 ||          || 500.00   || 2500.00   
13/01/2012 || 2000.00  ||          || 3000.00  
10/01/2012 || 1000.00  ||          || 1000.00   

Do it yourself first and then compare the solutions.
