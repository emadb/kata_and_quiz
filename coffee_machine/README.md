### Coffee Machine kata ###
The aim of this kata is to write a program that emulates the behaviour of an automatic coffee machine.

Here are the user stories:

- When the user switch on the coffee machine it shows it's credit that is zero
- As a user I can insert coin and the credit should raise accordingly
- When the credit is enough (30cents) I can get a coffee
- As a user I can cancel the operation and get back the money
- As a user I can use a key to get a coffee
- As a user I can recharge the key inserting the key in the machine and add some coins
- As a user I can get different beverages of different prices
- Using the key I can have a free coffee every 10 coffee
- Using the key I have a discount of 10% on every beverage
